# Lib Directory

This directory contains utility functions, configurations, and shared logic.

## Structure

- `utils/` - Utility functions and helpers
- `validations/` - Schema validations (Zod, Yup, etc.)
- `api/` - API client configurations and helpers
- `constants/` - Application constants and configuration values

## Guidelines

- Keep functions pure and testable
- Export everything through index files
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Document complex utility functions
