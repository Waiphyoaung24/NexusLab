# Components Directory

This directory contains all reusable React components organized by category.

## Structure

- `ui/` - Basic UI components (buttons, inputs, modals, etc.)
- `layout/` - Layout components (header, footer, sidebar, etc.)
- `forms/` - Form-related components
- `common/` - Common shared components

## Guidelines

- Each component should have its own directory with an `index.ts` file for exports
- Include TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Follow the naming convention: PascalCase for component names
- Include Storybook stories for complex components (optional)
